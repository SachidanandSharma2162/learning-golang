GoLang utilizes the features of cloud specially unlike other programming languages,
very easy powerful language.

It is complied and interpreted as well.
Go tool can run file directly, without virtual machine

We use Golang (or Go) because it’s fast, simple, and powerful — especially for building things like servers, APIs, cloud services, and even networking tools. Here's a quick breakdown:

Speed: Go compiles directly to machine code, so it runs really fast (almost like C or C++).

Simplicity: The syntax is super clean and minimal, making code easier to read and maintain.

Concurrency: Go has built-in support for handling many tasks at the same time (using goroutines), which is perfect for web servers and real-time apps.

Cross-Platform: You can build apps for Linux, Windows, Mac from the same codebase easily.

Big Ecosystem: Tons of libraries and tools, especially for backend and cloud development (Docker, Kubernetes, etc., are written in Go!).

Memory Efficient: Good performance without using tons of RAM.

Great for Microservices: Lightweight and efficient, ideal for building lots of small services that talk to each other.

Goroutines ka thoda intro (kyunki concurrency Go ka hero feature hai)

Case sensitive,
variable should be known in advance
everything is a type

Variable:

Go ke Main Types:

Type	Example	Description
int	var x int = 10	Integer numbers (whole numbers)
float64	var y float64 = 3.14	Floating point (decimal numbers)
string	var name string = "Arin"	Text (strings)
bool	var flag bool = true	Boolean (true/false)

since LoginToken starts with capital L so it is now automatically a public variable
