🧩 What is an Interface in Go?
An interface is a type that specifies a method set — it defines what methods a type must have, but not how they are implemented.

💡 In simple words: interfaces are contracts — if a type implements all the methods of an interface, it satisfies the interface.

✅ Defining an Interface

type Shape interface {
	Area() float64
	Perimeter() float64
}

🧠 Key Points:
✅ No implements keyword needed — Go uses implicit interfaces.
🔁 A type automatically satisfies an interface if it implements all required methods.
🎯 Interfaces enable polymorphism — you can write functions that work with different types.
